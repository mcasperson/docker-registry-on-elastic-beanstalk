## Quick Setup

 * clone the repository
 * zip it ```zip -r docker-registry.zip . .ebextensions```
 * set up an S3 bucket and a user to access it (you will need the users keys)
 * create a new app and environment in elastic beanstalk to run a Docker WebServer
 * when the wizard asks you set the following environment variables:
  * ```S3_BUCKET``` name of the bucket
  * ```S3_ACCESS_KEY``` access key of the created user
  * ```S3_SECRET_KEY``` secret key of the created user
  * ```SECRET_KEY``` a random secret key, the registry uses this for secret things (https://github.com/dotcloud/docker-registry#general-options)
  * ```SETTINGS_FLAVOR``` set to `s3`
 * when the wizard asks you for the app, upload the zip file
 * complete the wizard
 * wait for the environment and app to spin up
 * profit
 
the registry will be running on port 80 (not 5000)

To test, open http://beanstalk_app_name.elasticbeanstalk.com/v1/_ping. You should see a result of {}.
